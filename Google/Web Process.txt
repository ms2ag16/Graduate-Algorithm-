1. browserï¼š check website format if pass then 
2. browser by default use http not https
3. browser contact DNS and figure out what is the IP for webiste
4. DNS check its own cache, if not check DNS Server 8.8.8.8, DNS package its request from its own 1.1.1.1. DNS contact TCP/IP. 
5. UDP in TCP/IP get the request_package and assign sender_number and receiver_number, and leave the update_package to IP
6. IP figure out the IP router and find that it's outside the gateway, and IP does not know the MAC address
MAC=(A media access control address of a device is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) )
7. IP find local ARP to find MACxx.xx.xx.xx.xx.xx
ARP= Address Resolution Protocol is a protocol for
mapping an Internet Protocol address (IP address) to a physical machine address that is recognized in the local network.
8. IP arrive Gateway and then go Internet and arrived 8.8.8.8, which is the DNS Server
9. DNS Server contact DNS root '.' (total 13 in the world) and DNS root find out the IP address
10. Now, broswer get the IP of the website. Now browser contact TCP/IP again to visit the IP address
11. And this time is TCP connect and usually it's done by 3-hands-shake
12. Three hand-shake are transder via IP
13. After 3-hands_shake, TCP has connect a valid connection and inform the Browser. 
14. Browser package the http request to TCP and TCP assign receiver and sender, and again it's IP in charge of transfer. 
15. After IP delivered the package, http server and the server may return a notice that the website has bee redirected. HTTP Redirect
16. Browser noticed the Redirect and again to go the redirect website 
  16.1. This time, after 3-hands_shake, browser does not send package to TCP but to TLS. 
  16.2. TSL put secure on top of the package and then TLS send the package to TCP again. 
17. TCP package delivered to http server and return the website to browser.
